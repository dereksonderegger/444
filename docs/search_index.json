There are several functions to do common statistical tests but because those functions were developed early in R’s history, there is some inconsistency in how those functions work. There have been some attempts to standardize modeling object interfaces, but there were always be a little weirdness. 5.1 formula notation Most statistical modeling functions rely on a formula based interface. The primary purpose is to provide a consistent way to designate which columns in a data frame are the response variable and which are the explanatory variables. In particular the notation is \\[\\underbrace{y}_{\\textrm{response}} \\;\\;\\; \\underbrace{\\sim}_{\\textrm{is a function of}} \\;\\;\\; \\underbrace{x}_{\\textrm{explanatory}}\\] Mathematicians often refer to these terms as the Left Hand Side (LHS) and Right Hand Side (RHS). The LHS is always the response and the RHS contains the explanatory variables. In R, the LHS is usually just a single variable in the data. However the RHS can contain multiple variables and in complicated relationships. Right Hand Side Terms Meaning x1 + x2 Both x1 and x2 are additive explanatory variables. In this format, we are adding only the main effects of the x1 and x2 variables. x1:x2 This is the interaction term between x1 and x2 x1 * x2 Because whenever we add an interaction term to a model, we want to also have the main effects. So this is a short cut for adding the main effect of x1 and x2 and also the interaction term x1:x2. (x1 + x2 + x3)^2 This is the main effects of x1, x2, and x3 and also all of the second order interactions. poly(x, degree=2) This fits the degree 2 polynomial. When fit like this, R produces an orthogonal basis for the polynomial, which is more computationally stable, but won’t be appropiate for interpreting the polynomial coefficients. poly(x, degree=2, raw=TRUE) This fits the degree 2 polynomial using \\(\\beta_0 + \\beta_1 x + \\beta_2 x^2\\) and the polynomial polynomial coefficients are suitable for interpretation. I( x^2 ) Ignore the usual rules for interpreting formulas and do the mathematical calculation. This is not necessary for things like sqrt(x) or log(x) but required if there is a conflict between mathematics and the formula interpretation. 5.2 Building models 5.2.1 t-tests 5.2.2 lm objects 5.3 Accessor function using traditional functions 5.4 Accessing model results using broom "]
