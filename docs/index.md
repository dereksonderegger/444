# Preface {-}
This book is intended to provide students with a resource for learning R while using it during an introductory statistics course. The Introduction section covers common issues that students in a typical statistics course will encounter and provides a simple examples and does not attempt to be exhaustive. The Deeper Details section addresses issues that commonly arise in many data wrangling situations and is intended to give students a deep enough understanding of R that they will be able to use it as their primary computing resource to manipulate, graph and model data.
