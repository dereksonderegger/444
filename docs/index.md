# Preface {-}
These notes were originally written for an introductory statistics course for grad students in biological sciences. 



## Acknowledgements {-}
I have had the pleasure of interacting with a great number of talented mathematicians and statisticians in my schooling.  In particular I am deeply indebted to Dr Robert Boik and Dr Warren Esty as well as my Ph.D. adviser Dr Jan Hannig. 

As a professor at Northern Arizona University, I am grateful for the feedback and comradery of my fellow statisticans, particularly Dr St. Laurent.

Finally, I am deeply appreciative of the support given to me by my wife, Aubrey.
