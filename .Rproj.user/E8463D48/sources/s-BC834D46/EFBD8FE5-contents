## Undergraduate Programs <br> BS Mathematics

* A traditional/commonly structured Math program. 
* Encourage students to have a minor in another field.
* Many opportunities for Undergraduate Research.
    * FAMUS - Friday afternoon undergraduate seminar series.
    * Capstone course is now modeled after undergraduate research.


## Undergraduate Programs <br> BSEd Mathematics

* Intended for Secondary Ed teachers
* Culminates in an in-school teaching experience.


# Undergraduate Programs <br> BS Data Science

## What is Data Science?

* Data Science is an umbrella term that encompasses skills and knowledge that are traditionally separated as Statistics and Computer Science.
* Data Science considers:
    * Acquiring data: e.g. Web Scraping, experimental design, population/sample misalignment.
    * Data Wrangling: Manipulating raw data into a usable format.
    * Data Maintainence: Data base design and storage.
    * Analysis: Inferential and predictive analyses.
    * Communication: Data reporting and visualization.

## Data Science is done in Context

* Almost always requires subject domain knowledge:
    * Microbiology, economics, ecology, actuarial science, finance, transportation, etc.
    
* Requires asking the *right question* and answering it with the 
*right data*.

* Because data science can mix with nearly any field, it doesn't make sense to pair with any one particular subject area.
