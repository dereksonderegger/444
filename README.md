# Introduction to Data Science with R

This is the Git Repository for the source code and materials for a book that
is used to teach R and data science. I host the "pretty" version of the book
at [https://bookdown.org/dereksonderegger/444/](https://bookdown.org/dereksonderegger/444/).

These notes began before Hadley Wickham had created his R for data science book 
but there is quite a lot of similarity. The largest distinction is that these notes 
try to give a gentle first introduction
to various topics (chapters 1-7) which students progress through in the first 5 
weeks of a semester. At that point students have had enough R to get through an
introductory statistics course. The "deeper details" section gets into more
complicated issues that I think students need to be exposed to.

There are still uncountable numbers of grammatical mistakes and mispellings and
I am always happy to have pull requests to fix those.
